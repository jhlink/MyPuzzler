User Feedback:
- Environment reminds user of a dungeon in Elder Scrolls or a very old Doom game.
- The environment is looks noticeably blocky, especially the components that are placed together. 
- Scale and height are acceptable and comfortably at eye level with user.
- Individual componenets are very well detailed graphically. 
- No motion sickness or dizziness from experience. 
- Size of the room is just right and doesn't induce claustrophobia.
- There should be something beyond the door instead of a blank horizon.
- The floating orbs are cool.
- Lights are not too intense or bright and meld well with the environment.

Findings:
- Should correct the placement of various assets so that they look naturally connected.
- The gate should show another room or be sealed with a closed door, such that the blank horizon is hidden from the user.
